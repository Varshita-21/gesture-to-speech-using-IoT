A paralyzed person can send send notifications to his near and dear ones just by using hand gestures through wearable glove. 
The wearable glove is integerated with flex sensors whose resitance values change with bend angles. The resistance values can be used to understand the gesture made by user. 
Based on the gesture made, data is sent to ThingSpeak which in turn is sent to MIT app inventor. 
The application sends SMS to the contact specified by the user. A voice alert is also sent to the contact so that he never misses out any need.
each combination of fingers(gesture) sends a new requirement. For example, Go to restroom, Need medicines, Need some fresh air, Need food and EMERGENCY!.
